Method: Divide the site into 4 parts-
1) Upper navigation bar as Flex.
2) Red advertisement frame for holiday shopping as Flex.
3) The rest of the site without the bottom(after all the pictures),I will divide it by a grid with 6 rows and 2 columns where the first 3 screens will be spread over 2 columns. I will use a repeating pattern of the caption on each screen by mixin.
4) The table at the bottom will be implemented by a grid of 6 columns and 1 row. and the navigation bar will be implemented by Flex.
